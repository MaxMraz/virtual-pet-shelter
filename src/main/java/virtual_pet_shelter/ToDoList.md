# More Urgent
Send a message to the console when a pet dies
Send a message to the console when you're shut down for killing too many pets

# Less Urgent
make it so when taking in pets, their stats are randomly varied +-2 from the average.

# Not Urgent
Add a money system
-Feeding a single pet should cost $X
-Feeding all pets should cost $(0.5X*number of pets) (or something?)
-Same with watering
-Adopting out pets brings in at least $15X (maybe this should be tied to their happiness? Happiness/10*15X?)
Make feeding and watering print a description of what your food and drink of choice is, pulling randomly from an array of strings.
