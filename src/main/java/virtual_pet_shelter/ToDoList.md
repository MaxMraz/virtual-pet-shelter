Send a message to the console when you're shut down for killing too many pets  

# Less Urgent
make it so when taking in pets, their stats are randomly varied +-2 from the average.  

# Not Urgent
Add a money system  
-Feeding a single pet should cost 5 dollars  
-Feeding all pets should cost (3 dollars x number of pets) (or something?)  
-Same with watering  
-Adopting out pets brings in at least 75 dollars (since the pet is there a minimum of 10 turns where you're spending money on it.)  
-maybe this should be tied to their happiness? Happiness/10 x 75 dollars? So VERY happy pets return more profit?  
Make feeding and watering print a description of what your food and drink of choice is, pulling randomly from an array of strings.
